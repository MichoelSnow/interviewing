# Interviewing

This repository contains guides alongs with tips and tricks based upon my experience being on both sides of the data science interview process.  In addition to the usual YMMV disclaimers, please note that I have pretty much exclusively intreviewed for and as a data scientist/machine learning engineer, but there should be significant overlap with other data science positions.

## Take Home

This folder contains functions and scripts used to streamline the data science take home challenge.  I found that just doing the basics of setting up the environment and EDA would take more than the "4-5 hours" typically recommended for the time I was supposed to allot to the work.  I created the scripts and functions inside this folder to take care of all that grunt work.

There are also included cases showing how I approach the take home challenge using a variety of open source datasets.
